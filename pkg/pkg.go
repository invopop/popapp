package pkg

// ABOUT: Package pkg provides a set of utilities for the application.
// Here you can define clients, services, and other components which are external to the application.
// These components can be used to interact with external systems or services.
// For example, you can define a client for a REST API.
// Each component should be well-documented and easy to use.
// They should also be defined in their own directory.
